Music teachers website
1. I already made Figma layout and I use Flex-box and BEM metodology
2. Actually, I thought I know a lot about CSS, almost everything but BEM Methodology - That's something. I've been racking my brains trying to figure it out. 
3. I figured out how it works. Apparently
4. I've started to adapt the website to another screen and I've instantly got a problem with behaviour one element in tablet view. Something wrong. Second music sign moves wrong. I should to figure it out 
I'm still trying to adapt to phone version and I made a hamburger. 
Actually, I don't see the point in using BEM in building small websites
